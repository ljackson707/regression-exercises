# Regression
Regression work

# Exercises:

1) Create a directory named regression-exercises within your codeup-data-science directory.

2) Initialize this directory as a git repository.

3) Create a README.md file that outlines the contents.

4) Create a repository on github with the same name (regression-exercises) and link your local repo to the remote.

5) Add, commit, and push the readme file.

6) The filename for this exercise is wrangle.py.

7) As always, add, commit, and push your work.

# Problem 1

Throughout the exercises for Regression in Python lessons, you will use the following example scenario: As a customer analyst, I want to know who has spent the most money with us over their lifetime. I have monthly charges and tenure, so I think I will be able to use those two attributes as features to estimate total_charges. I need to do this within an average of $5.00 per customer 

The first step will be to acquire and prep the data. Do your work for this exercise in a file named wrangle.py.

1) Acquire customer_id, monthly_charges, tenure, and total_charges from telco_churn database for all customers with a 2 year contract.

2) Walk through the steps above using your new dataframe. You may handle the missing values however you feel is appropriate.

3) End with a python file wrangle.py that contains the function, wrangle_telco(), that will acquire the data and return a dataframe cleaned with no missing values.
